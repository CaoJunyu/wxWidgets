October 10, 2023 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.3 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.3

This release contains many important bug fixes, including fixing some
regressions in the previous 3.2.x releases:

- Fix some key codes when using non-US keyboard layout in wxGTK and
  generate ket events for Command+Alt+Letter combination in wxOSX.
- Fix wxTranslations::AddStdCatalog().
- Fix setting Chinese and some other locales in wxOSX and setting
  Ukrainian locale in wxMSW.

In particular, a number of Wayland-specific bugs were fixed in wxGTK:

- Fix possible crash when using IME.
- Make hiding wxGLCanvas work and avoid catastrophically slowing down
  the entire program when it is hidden.
- Fix wxComboCtrl popup behaviour.
- Fix showing popup menu without active event.
- Fix wxPreferencesEditor size under Wayland.

Last but not least, there are also some user-visible enhancements in
this release:

- Don't allow pasting characters forbidden by wxTextValidator.
- Do allow entering temporary invalid value when using numeric validators.
- Fix entering dates in wxGenericDatePicker in nb_NO and other locales
  using names for the months in short date format.
- Keep wxProgressDialog size unchanged when updating the message.


All in all, this release includes more than 200 fixes from almost 50
contributors, please see the full change log for more details:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.2.3/docs/changes.txt

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
